# Silly String

A string in Ruby is an data type that holds words, numbers, and other characters. A string is just data. This lab is going to be a refresher on how to create and manipulate strings. You'll code your solution in silly_string.rb 

You can read about strings and all the methods available [here](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/String.html`).




##Challenge:
1. Create a string that contains your favorite word. It can be in any language!

2. Using a method built into ruby, capitalize every letter in the string you just created

3. Now let's make all the characters lowercase in the string `"IM NOT SHOUTING"`

4. Using a method built into ruby, count how many letters are in the string `"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"`

5. Now let's add more words to that string, using `+` just like in math. That's called concatenation. Let's add together to the two strings `"wow"` and `"mom"`.

6. Now let's capitalize just the first letter of the sentence `"i really like programming"`

7. Now let's try to split that sentence into strings that each contain and individual word. The `split` method takes an argument of what you're splitting by. You put that argument between quotation marks. You would pass a comma is you were splitting a comma-delimited list. Here we're splitting by a space, so you you'd pass a space between quotes.
